# Configuring Atom

Atom is powerful text editor where you'll be spending most of your time writing while programming. Out of the box, it can already do a lot for you.

You also have the ability to add additional packages and configure the settings for it to level-up your text editing experience. We typically recommend new users to configure their Atom with following settings:

1. [Getting Started with Configuring](#getting-started-with-configuring)
2. [Core Settings](#core-settings)
3. [Editor Settings](#editor-settings)
4. [Invisibles Settings](#invisibles-settings)
5. [Installing Packages](#installing-packages)
6. [Recommended Packages](#recommended-packages)
